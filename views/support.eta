                <h2>Keep the Site Running</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, this website runs on render.com's free tier. As a result, the service is a bit slow
                    (especially after a long period of inactivity), and potentially unreliable. By donating to
                    SmallCategories, you can help fund a better hosting solution.
                </p>
                <h2>Improve the Database</h2>
                <p>
                    Extending the range of the SmallCategories database is extremely computationally intensive. Some of
                    the larger computations have been run on rented cloud computing resources, which I've paid for out
                    of pocket. However, I can't afford to do much more of this. By donating to SmallCategories, you can
                    help fund more of these computations.
                </p>
