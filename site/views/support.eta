                <h2>Keep the Site Running</h2>
                <p>
                    It costs a small amount of money each year to keep this domain registered, which I pay for out of pocket. Besides this, the site runs on the generosity of various web startups.
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                    The web server runs on <a href="https://render.com">render.com</a>'s free tier. As a result, the web server spins down every time there is a short period of inactivity, and so the site is very slow to load if you're the first person to access it within a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>
                    The postgres database that this site relies on is hosted on <a href="https://supabase.com">supabase.com</a>'s free tier, which limits the database size to 512MB. This limit has almost been reached!
                    </li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Improve the Database</h2>
                <p>
                    Extending the range of the SmallCategories database is extremely computationally intensive. Some of
                    the larger computations have been run on rented cloud computing resources, which I've paid for out
                    of pocket. However, I can't afford to do much more of this. By donating to SmallCategories, you can
                    help fund more of these computations.
                </p>
