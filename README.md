# SmallCategories-site

The code for [smallcats.info](https://smallcats.info), a website for navigating the [SmallCategories database](https://github.com/diracdeltafunk/SmallCategories), is contained in the `site` directory.

`populate_kb.py` populates the `KnowledgeBase` table on supabase, and requres [pycatlib](https://github.com/diracdeltafunk/pycatlib).
